# TABConf6 - Coordinate Workshop
This workshop is to better explain and define the capabilities and tradeoffs of Coordinate; A Bitcoin L2 Sidechain. What this document doesn't cover is the security side of L2s on Bitcoin and the complete feature set of Coordinate. Instead focusing on the interactions that a user can have with a Coordinate node and existing infrastructure. 

## Hello World - Overview ðŸŒŽ
 - Wallets and RPC - Using Python to Interact with a Node.
 - Asset Transfers - Browser Extension Wallet
 - Asset Creation [NFT]
 - Testnet 3/4 Giveaway

## Requirements âœ…
 - Laptop
 - [Chrome / Chromium](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - _brave might work?_
 - [Coordinate Browser Extension Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/anduro/khebhoaoppjeidmdkpdglmlhghnooijn)

## Phase One - Get your Wallet ID (BIP39)
To get the soft introduction to Coordinate going and avoid any delays in transaction confirmation please download the [Chrome Browser Wallet](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and set it up with the defaults. For the sake of the demo and because we are dealing with Testnet Bitcoins only, security of a seed phase backup can be foregone and the wallet recreated later with a more secure seed phrase at a later time. 

After you have create your seed phrase, please fetch your Testnet(3/4) address from the browser wallet in the Bitcoin category. *NOTE* Your Testnet3/4 address will be the same on both networks but carry a different balance depending on which network you have selected. Please also Fetch your testnet Coordinate address.

The next step is to visit my simple TABConf6 [Testnet Distribution Portal](https://tabconf.testnet4.io) and enter your Testnet Address AND Coordinate Testnet Address.

## Phase Two - Connect and Use Python Script to Get Balance
In this phase we will start interacting with a Coordinate Sidechain node, *Please note for the sake of this demo lets not deliberately attack the public node or drain the wallets.* The first script that we will be interacting with is one that simply will let you check your ballance.

## Phase Three - Asset Transfer

## Phase Four - Asset Creation
